The urban city types average fare never crosses the $30 threshold but this is made up by maintaining the highest total fares
and highest total rides by city type.

Although rural areas tend to have the highest average fare, it would be interesting to see how many miles each ride is.
The urban city drivers are actually at the advantage with having a larger population of riders, they are able to make shorter 
trips at a more frequent rate. The urban city drivers also have the disadvantage of having more competition (more drivers).

Based on the data if someone were starting out as a driver for Pyber I would suggest to travel to the closest suburban areas.
Although they only account for 26.3% of total rides they would have less drivers to compete against. As they get the hang of 
the job I would advise to develop a strategy wherein they pick up riders from suburban areas and take them to urban areas and
vice versa. While the high fare of the rural areas might be enticing, the infrequency of riders will offset the total money 
the driver has a chance to make.
